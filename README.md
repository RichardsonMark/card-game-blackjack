# card-game-blackjack
Card game Java enums and loops lab for CodeClan professional software development course.

This project expands on a lab we did to create a simple card came. It runs a simple, cut down version of Blackjack (2 cards dealt, instant win if hand value = 21, able to stick or twist and go bust if hand > 21)

In completing the task, I have noted the following logic that would need investigated if the game is developed any further:
- If more than one player gets blackjack the game should be a draw.
- Should the game exclaim 'blackjack' (or it still technically blackjack) if you get 21 using more than 2 cards?
- If you go bust, need to look at then making any aces in hand low.
- Could introduce splitting the hand. 
- Could introduce user input to choose whether to twist or stick?
- Give player a name/allow them to add own name so it easier to tell who the player is.
- If 2 players and 1 goes bust, the game ends. Need to update this so the other player can keep playing/win.
